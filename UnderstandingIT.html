<p>i found them fascinating and i always lovedto learn new things. When my dad couldnt work things out </p>
<p>he always let me tamper with because without fail i managed to find the solution.The IT side was always in the </p>
<p>back of my mind till one day a mate said as a joke "geoff you know what you need in life a purpose"</p>
<p>i took that statement to heart and here i am following my purpose.I have only minimal It experience </p>
<p>about two to three years ago i was at the start of a game design course due to personal</P>
<p>reason i was unable to continue .Now here i am.</p>

<p>At the start i looked at universitys and couldn't decide exactly what feild of IT i wanted</p>
<p>to do  it was the only pbut in the end i did research as well as asked open university's questions</p>
