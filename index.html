on a computer. Then one day it just hit me i love data i love creating and building </p>
things and i love a challenge i may not be super fast at solving but i never give up till i have</p>
solved the problem.
<br>
<br>
<p> My interest in IT is simple i lovr to be helpful i am very inquistive i want </p>
to build programs that help develop society and adavnce our technology but to do that </P>
need to take it one step at a time.</p>
<br>
<p> I have to say i think my interest in It has alwaysbecause my dad was always around computers</p>
i found them fascinating and i always lovedto learn new things. When my dad couldnt work things out </p>
he always let me tamper with because without fail i managed to find the solution.The IT side was always in the </p>
back of my mind till one day a mate said as a joke "geoff you know what you need in life a purpose"</p>
i took that statement to heart and here i am following my purpose.I have only minimal It experience </p>
about two to three years ago i was at the start of a game design course due to personal</P>
 reason i was unable to continue .now here i am.</p>

At the start i looked at universitys and couldn't decide exactly what feild of IT i wanted </p>
to do  it was the only pbut in the end i did research as well as asked open university's questions</p>
until i was happy that this is was i wanted i am hoping to get my Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
currently signed up to intordution in IT then once i have completed this i move to programming</p>
<br>

<h2>My ideal job</h2>

when it comes to IT but if i had to give one as an example it would probaly have to be this one</p>

<p>So this is a job for full stack a php devloper the term full stack means that you know and can</p>
profeciently perform both front end and back end of coding php is a form of computer lanuage that is </p>
one amoung many that are used in the industry. This job is appealing to me because i like the</P>
idea of writing code and being presented challenges to work as a team to try and solve </p>
i also love to learn new things so that kind of job you would always be presented with oppertunties</P>
to learn new code and programs.

the qualifications i believe you would need to have are
<ul>
  <li>
    An eye for details.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to work with a team to get the job done.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    Obviously experience in in computer code majoritly PHP and java.
  </li>
  <li>
    Qualifications in Computer Science or related technical discipline or practical experience that would equate to the same level.
  </li>
  <li>
    being a data driven problem solver the focuses strongly on code quality and conducts themselves with good engeneering practices.
  </li>
  <li>
