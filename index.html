<br>
<p> Now to summerise a bit about my life. I am currently a team leader for a</p>
third party logistic company on average i spend 5 hours of my work day on </p>
on a computer. Then one day it just hit me i love data i love creating and building </p>
things and i love a challenge i may not be super fast at solving but i never give up till i have</p>
solved the problem.</p>
<br>
<h1><strong> Abit about me and IT</strong></h1>
<p>My interest in IT is simple i lovr to be helpful i am very inquistive i want </p>
to build programs that help develop society and adavnce our technology but to do that </P>
need to take it one step at a time.</p>
<br>
<p> I have to say i think my interest in It has alwaysbecause my dad was always around computers</p>
i found them fascinating and i always lovedto learn new things. When my dad couldnt work things out </p>
he always let me tamper with because without fail i managed to find the solution.The IT side was always in the </p>
back of my mind till one day a mate said as a joke "geoff you know what you need in life a purpose"</p>
i took that statement to heart and here i am following my purpose.I have only minimal It experience </p>
about two to three years ago i was at the start of a game design course due to personal</P>
reason i was unable to continue .Now here i am.</p>
<br>
<p>At the start i looked at universitys and couldn't decide exactly what feild of IT i wanted</p>
to do  it was the only pbut in the end i did research as well as asked open university's questions</p>
until i was happy that this is was i wanted i am hoping to get my Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
currently signed up to intordution in IT then once i have completed this i move to programming</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>My ideal job</h2>
My ideal job would be a hard one to pinpoint because there is alot of feild i like in when</p>
when it comes to IT but if i had to give one as an example it would probaly have to be this one</p>

<br>
<p>So this is a job for full stack a php devloper the term full stack means that you know and can</p>
profeciently perform both front end and back end of coding php is a form of computer lanuage that is </p>
one amoung many that are used in the industry. This job is appealing to me because i like the</P>
idea of writing code and being presented challenges to work as a team to try and solve </p>
i also love to learn new things so that kind of job you would always be presented with oppertunties</P>
to learn new code and programs.

the qualifications i believe you would need to have are
<ul>
  <li>
    An eye for details.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to work with a team to get the job done.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to following task.
  </li>
  <li>
    Obviously experience in in computer code majoritly PHP and java.
  </li>
  <li>
    Qualifications in Computer Science or related technical discipline or practical experience that would equate to the same level.
  </li>
  <li>
    being a data driven problem solver the focuses strongly on code quality and conducts themselves with good engeneering practices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Has the ambition to want to learn new things and solve complex problems.
  </li>
</ul>
  <br>
<p>
  So i might not have the coding qualifications or experience but i do have a good eye</p>
i also am a great problem solver and as i mention before i am a great learner i love to take</p>
on responsibilites and always up to learner new things especially when it comes to coding</p>
the other thing i am good at is analysing data especially when the data is there in front of me </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  my plans to achieve this goal is firstly gain the education i need then during my education</p>
i will research and learn as much as i can, because when it comes to learn i tend to research it extensively</p>
as well as become more cofident in myself so that i am able to work in teams effectively. As soon i begin to learn PHP and </p>
java i will keep those skills up to date and in constant use. In the end it will be a long plan but in the end</p>
it will be acheieved.</p>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
<p> Honestly these test results were decieving because i may not be a fan of sudden changes of plan</p>
but i can be very creative an imaganative but overall it shows that there are some things i need to work </p>
to be a better and more active team player.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></p>
I think these result show i would be a reserved team player someone who would have trouble communicating</p>
with others and would be too afraid to add and advice or words in regards to issues with the project</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></p>
These kind of test can help you see where your teams strength and weakneses are and </p>
and tailor you project plan to get the best productivity out of each member</P>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
These results show that i have the ability the ability to pick most things up through</P>
auditory methods. Wether it is repeating the steps to myself or someone telling me </p>
my memory retains information through audio means.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></p>
i would have a tendancy to ask a lot of question and repeat what i am told to make sure</p>
i got all of the information correvtly.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></p>
This shows that many people have different learning techniques so when given this kind </p>
of information is handy because it shows the best method to get the information to the </p>
other team mates.</p>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
That i alot of my energy relies on the team which can be a bit of a downfall but overall </p>
is not the end of the world. It also shows that i am very agreeable which again can go both ways </p>
the bright side is i am open to others ideas and find it easy to go along with the idea </p>
the downfall is if there is something wrong with what someones else says i will have trouble speaking up</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></p>
The way this will effect me in a team based enviroment is that there might be times that i </p>
i have a great idea but wouldn't be able to speak up when the time comes. It also suggest i </p>
would fit well in most teams .</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></p>
This kind of test is great in the fact that it will give you a rough guide on possible</p>
personality clashes. It would also give you a rough idea on what tasks to assign to what people.</p>
