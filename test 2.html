    <strong>Hello there you are here to learn a bit about me.
    </strong></h3></p>
    <br>
<p>
   So, let us start with a little bit of information about me.
 </p>
<pre>
<strong>Name</strong> - Geoffrey Vincent Lloyd</p>
<strong>Student Number </strong> - S3865267</p>
<strong>Email Address </strong> - S3865267@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<strong>Nicknames </strong> - Harry Potter, Geoff, jeff-fa-fa</p>
<strong>Age </strong> - 30</p>
<strong>Area I Grew up in </strong> - Claymore, NSW</p>
</pre>
<br>
<p> Now to summarise a bit about my life. I am currently a team leader for a</p>
third party logistic company on average I spend 5 hours of my workday on </p>
on a computer. Then one day it just hit me I love data I love creating and building </p>
things and I love a challenge I may not be super-fast at solving but I never give up till I have</p>
solved the problem. </p>
<br>
<h1><strong> A bit about me and IT</strong></h1>
<p>My interest in IT is simple I love to be helpful I am very inquisitive I want </p>
<p>to build programs that help develop society and advance our technology but to do that </P>
<p>need to take it one step at a time. </p>
<br>
<p> I have to say I think my interest in It has always been because my dad was always around computers</p>
<p>I found them fascinating and I always love to learn new things. When my dad could not work things out </p>
<p>he always let me tamper with because without fail I managed to find the solution. The IT side was always in the </p>
<p>back of my mind till one day a mate said as a joke "Geoff you know what you need in life a purpose"</p>
<p>I took that statement to heart and here I am following my purpose. I have only minimal It experience </p>
<p>about two to three years ago I was at the start of a game design course due to personal</P>
<p>reason I was unable to continue. Now here I am.</p>
<br>
<p>At the start I looked at universities and could not decide exactly what field of IT I wanted</p>
<p>to do. It was the only in the end I did research as well as asked open university's questions</p>
<p>until I was happy that this is was, I wanted I am hoping to get my Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
<p>currently signed up to introduction in IT then once I have completed this I move to programming</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>My ideal job</h2>
My ideal job would be a hard one to pinpoint because there is a lot of field I like in when</p>
when it comes to IT but if I had to give one as an example it would probably have to be this one</p>

<br>
<p>So this is a job for full stack a php developer the term full stack means that you know and can</p>
proficiently perform both front end and back end of coding php is a form of computer language that is </p>
one among many that are used in the industry. This job is appealing to me because I like the</P>
idea of writing code and being presented challenges to work as a team to try and solve </p>
I also love to learn new things so that kind of job you would always be presented with opportunities</P>
to learn new code and programs.

the qualifications I believe you would need to have are
<ul>
  <li>
    An eye for details.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to work with a team to get the job done.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to following task.
  </li>
  <li>
    Obviously experience in in computer code majority PHP and java.
  </li>
  <li>
    Qualifications in Computer Science or related technical discipline or practical experience that would equate to the same level.
  </li>
  <li>
    being a data driven problem solver the focuses strongly on code quality and conducts themselves with good engineering practices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Has the ambition to want to learn new things and solve complex problems.
  </li>
</ul>
  <br>
<p>
  So, I might not have the coding qualifications or experience, but I do have a good eye</p>
I also am a great problem solver and as I mention before I am a great learner, I love to take</p>
on responsibility and always up to learner new things especially when it comes to coding</p>
the other thing I am good at is analysing data especially when the data is there in front of me </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  my plans to achieve this goal is firstly gain the education I need then during my education</p>
I will research and learn as much as I can, because when it comes to learn I tend to research it extensively</p>
as well as become more confident in myself so that I can work in teams effectively. As soon I begin to learn PHP and </p>
java I will keep those skills up to date and in constant use. In the end it will be a long plan but, in the end, </p>
it will be achieved. </p>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
<p> Honestly these test results were deceiving because I may not be a fan of sudden changes of plan</p>
but I can be very creative an imaginative but overall, it shows that there are some things I need to work </p>
to be a better and more active team player. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </strong></p>
I think these result show I would be a reserved team player someone who would have trouble communicating</p>
with others and would be too afraid to add and advice or words regarding issues with the project</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </strong></p>
These kinds of test can help you see where your team’s strength and weaknesses are and </p>
and tailor you project plan to get the best productivity out of each member</P>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
These results show that I have the ability the ability to pick most things up through</P>
auditory methods. Whether it is repeating the steps to myself or someone telling me </p>
my memory retains information through audio means. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </strong></p>
I would tend to ask a lot of question and repeat what I am told to make sure</p>
I got all the information correctly. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </strong></p>
This shows that many people have different learning techniques so when given this kind </p>
of information is handy because it shows the best method to get the information to the </p>
other teammates. </p>

</a>
<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
That is a lot of my energy relies on the team which can be a bit of a downfall but overall </p>
is not the end of the world. It also shows that I am very agreeable which again can go both ways </p>
the bright side is I am open to other’s ideas and find it easy to go along with the idea </p>
the downfall is if there is something wrong with what someone else says I will have trouble speaking up</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </strong></p>
The way this will affect me in a team-based environment is that there might be times that I </p>
I have a great idea but would not be able to speak up when the time comes. It also suggests I </p>
would fit well in most teams. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </strong></p>
This kind of test is great in the fact that it will give you a rough guide on possible</p>
personality clashes. It would also give you a rough idea on what tasks to assign to what people. </p>
