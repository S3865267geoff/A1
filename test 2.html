    <strong>Hello there you are here to learn a bit about me.
    </strong></h3></p>
    <br>
<p>
   So, let us start with a little bit of information about me.
   <br>
   <br>
 </p>
<pre>
<strong>Name</strong> - Geoffrey Vincent Lloyd</p>
<strong>Student Number </strong> - S3865267</p>
<strong>Email Address </strong> - S3865267@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<strong>Nicknames </strong> - Harry Potter, Geoff, jeff-fa-fa</p>
<strong>Age </strong> - 30</p>
<strong>Area I Grew up in </strong> - Claymore, NSW</p>
</pre>
<br>
<p> Now to summarise a bit about my life. I am currently a team leader for a</p>
third party logistic company on average I spend 5 hours of my workday on </p>
on a computer. Then one day it just hit me I love data I love creating and building </p>
things and I love a challenge I may not be super-fast at solving but I never give up till I have</p>
solved the problem. </p>
<br>
<h1><strong> A bit about me and IT</strong></h1>
<p>My interest in IT is simple I love to be helpful I am very inquisitive I want </p>
<p>to build programs that help develop society and advance our technology but to do that </P>
<p>need to take it one step at a time. </p>
<br>
<p> I have to say I think my interest in It has always been because my dad was always around computers</p>
<p>I found them fascinating and I always love to learn new things. When my dad could not work things out </p>
<p>he always let me tamper with because without fail I managed to find the solution. The IT side was always in the </p>
<p>back of my mind till one day a mate said as a joke "Geoff you know what you need in life a purpose"</p>
<p>I took that statement to heart and here I am following my purpose. I have only minimal It experience </p>
<p>about two to three years ago I was at the start of a game design course due to personal</P>
<p>reason I was unable to continue. Now here I am.</p>
<br>
<p>At the start I looked at universities and could not decide exactly what field of IT I wanted</p>
<p>to do. It was the only in the end I did research as well as asked open university's questions</p>
<p>until I was happy that this is was, I wanted I am hoping to get my Bachelor of Information Technology</p>
<p>currently signed up to introduction in IT then once I have completed this I move to programming</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>My ideal job</h2>
My ideal job would be a hard one to pinpoint because there is a lot of field I like in when</p>
when it comes to IT but if I had to give one as an example it would probably have to be this one</p>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50039750?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=a70dae2b-bde2-4e2c-a0d9-a8841418a993">

<br>
<p>So this is a job for full stack a php developer the term full stack means that you know and can</p>
proficiently perform both front end and back end of coding php is a form of computer language that is </p>
one among many that are used in the industry. This job is appealing to me because I like the</P>
idea of writing code and being presented challenges to work as a team to try and solve </p>
I also love to learn new things so that kind of job you would always be presented with opportunities</P>
to learn new code and programs.

the qualifications I believe you would need to have are
<ul>
  <li>
    An eye for details.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to work with a team to get the job done.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to following task.
  </li>
  <li>
    Obviously experience in in computer code majority PHP and java.
  </li>
  <li>
    Qualifications in Computer Science or related technical discipline or practical experience that would equate to the same level.
  </li>
  <li>
    being a data driven problem solver the focuses strongly on code quality and conducts themselves with good engineering practices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Has the ambition to want to learn new things and solve complex problems.
  </li>
</ul>
  <br>
<p>
  So, I might not have the coding qualifications or experience, but I do have a good eye</p>
I also am a great problem solver and as I mention before I am a great learner, I love to take</p>
on responsibility and always up to learner new things especially when it comes to coding</p>
the other thing I am good at is analysing data especially when the data is there in front of me </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  my plans to achieve this goal is firstly gain the education I need then during my education</p>
I will research and learn as much as I can, because when it comes to learn I tend to research it extensively</p>
as well as become more confident in myself so that I can work in teams effectively. As soon I begin to learn PHP and </p>
java I will keep those skills up to date and in constant use. In the end it will be a long plan but, in the end, </p>
it will be achieved. </p>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
<p> Honestly these test results were deceiving because I may not be a fan of sudden changes of plan</p>
but I can be very creative an imaginative but overall, it shows that there are some things I need to work </p>
to be a better and more active team player. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </strong></p>
I think these result show I would be a reserved team player someone who would have trouble communicating</p>
with others and would be too afraid to add and advice or words regarding issues with the project</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </strong></p>
These kinds of test can help you see where your team’s strength and weaknesses are and </p>
and tailor you project plan to get the best productivity out of each member</P>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
These results show that I have the ability the ability to pick most things up through</P>
auditory methods. Whether it is repeating the steps to myself or someone telling me </p>
my memory retains information through audio means. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </strong></p>
I would tend to ask a lot of question and repeat what I am told to make sure</p>
I got all the information correctly. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </strong></p>
This shows that many people have different learning techniques so when given this kind </p>
of information is handy because it shows the best method to get the information to the </p>
other teammates. </p>

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </strong></p>
That is a lot of my energy relies on the team which can be a bit of a downfall but overall </p>
is not the end of the world. It also shows that I am very agreeable which again can go both ways </p>
the bright side is I am open to other’s ideas and find it easy to go along with the idea </p>
the downfall is if there is something wrong with what someone else says I will have trouble speaking up</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </strong></p>
The way this will affect me in a team-based environment is that there might be times that I </p>
I have a great idea but would not be able to speak up when the time comes. It also suggests I </p>
would fit well in most teams. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </strong></p>
This kind of test is great in the fact that it will give you a rough guide on possible</p>
personality clashes. It would also give you a rough idea on what tasks to assign to what people. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><h1><strong> Overview of an idea</strong></h1></p>
My idea is for a site that would be called the adventures tavern that will make it easier</p>
for role players of any genre and any gaming system the ability to organise game amongst fellow</p>
people in the community as well as share stories of the adventures they might have had with their</p>
party. Done right this could have so much potential maybe not as big as Facebook. It could be used</p>
as an outlet. Or a place for other members to seek advice with story ideas or character designs.</p>
This can also help dungeon masters know the kind of experience level the player may have as well</p>
as see what kind player that person may be, To see if the player would fit with the other members</p>
of the party.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><h1><strong>Motivation behind the idea</strong></h1></p>
<p>Just in a site that allows players to play roleplaying games virtually called D20 there is over 5,000,000</p>
as of February 2020  and in one particular gaming system there is about 13.7 million players that play</p>
the game and that number will only grow over time as these kind of games are becoming more popular in society.</p>
I admit it might not be life changing helpful but there is nothing worse than being a new player to the community</p>
and everything being overwhelming and not knowing where to look. This site would eliminate a lot of those issues</p>
and help new people to the community find games a lot easier. The fact that it is a site designed specifically</p>
for role-players should also eliminate the uncomfortableness of being judge as a lot of new players would have this</p>
kind of fear.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><h1><strong>Descrition of the idea</strong></h1></p>
<p>The first feature like many of these styles of sites is a secure system so that the user can log in and store all</p>
their information on. The main feature of the site is that the user is able to create a profile with the following information</p>
name, age , experience level , style of player, the area they live in, if they are available for day or night session, which days</p>
they are available , a bit about themselves, if they are a dungeon master or player or both, adding the gaming system they may play</p>
and if they have any interest in playing other system . Which would be available to update based on change of conditions. I would</p>
like to add a spot where the user is able to create profiles for the characters they have created and liked or they regularly use</p>
including pictures they may have of the character as well as stats and spells or equipment the character may have so that the user</p>
has an ease of access to get information on their character in the profile the user has the ability to add and be the only one to</p>
view notes that they mark important during session they may of played . I would also like to implement some sort of rewards system</p>
like a set amount experience for logging in or posting their experience in a session.
<br>
<br>
<p>There would be access to a chat-based program/messenger that would allow the user to connect to fellow community members or people they have</p>
formed a party with or if a dungeon master needs to contact a player.</p>
There would be a guild-based system (groups) that people can create so for example an artist that may do commission drawings can create a</p>
group to expose their work to the community to gather business as well as a particular gamming system for example pathfinder to allow the</p>
players who are looking to find a game they can post on the guild bulletin board. The guild section of the page will have a feature that</p>
allows a user to view guilds recommended to them based on system’s they may play or if the person already knows what they would like to </p>
search for they can. This will also help new players to find the help they need and be guided into the right direction either by more experienced</p>
user who know that gaming system or the guilds based on what they like. One of the other features would be a video chat with the ability for groups in</p>
scenarios like currently COVID-19 players are still able to gather online so that they can still go on with the campaign as well as have access to</p>
their character all in the one place.
<br>
<br>
<p>A dungeon master instead of having profile may be able to post small notes of a campaign or recordings of the</p>
session so that the players in the group or anyone who may be interested in listening or reading them. There would be a main bulletin board that</p>
allows players to post their experiences on or ask advice from fellow members for particular ideas also allowing players to add one another so that</p>
they can keep an easy link of contact with them it is as simple as looking at the friends list or in the spirit of the site it being</p>
called their book of contacts.</p>
